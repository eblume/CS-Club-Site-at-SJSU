# CS Club @ SJSU Web site

The github page for this project can be found at [https://github.com/eblume/CS-Club-Site-at-SJSU](https://github.com/eblume/CS-Club-Site-at-SJSU).

## About this project

The site is implemented as a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) project. It uses markdown, primarily, to format its pages. The project is still in its infancy and we have not yet identified all of the technologies we wish to use, nor all the functionality we wish to implement.

## How to test the site

Testing the site in a local deployment (not meant for production release) is very simple, almost suspiciously so.

Follow [these very simply instructions (link)](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install) to install jekyll. (Summary: on most machines, just `sudo gem install jekyll`.) Then, in the root project directory, run:

    $ jekyll --serve

Then point your browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). It should be running!

## How to contribute

To contribute a change, please fork the [project](https://github.com/eblume/CS-Club-Site-at-SJSU) and hack way! When you've finished comitting your changes, send a 'Pull Request' through github, and the webmaster will review and merge your changes.

### Adding a new page

In short, to add a new page, you can either just add a file (like 'about.md'),
or you could also run `rake page name='NAME HERE'`. Your call.

### Adding a new post

Currently, posts are not well-supported. You can add one, though, just run
`rake post title='TITLE HERE'`. It will be added and accessible through the
atom feed or the archive, and later on when the front page supports posts it
will be supported there as well.
