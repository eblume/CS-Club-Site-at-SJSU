csclubsjsu.com is now hosted directly from GitHub via [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). What does this mean for you? It means that when you edit pages by submitting changes to the repo (or by clicking the edit links, which is functionally the same thing), your changes will go live as soon as a moderator approves them. It also means that our hosting is very resilliant and won't cost us anything (not that it has in the recent past - see below!).

I also want to take this opportunity to thank Kristopher who has been our very gracious web hosting provider up until now. Web hosting can be a headache for a non-profit and fairly volatile organization like ours, and we were very lucky to have a student offering to host our stuff for free.

However, we can now do some really cool new projects using the GitHub infrastructure. Stand by for more on that front!
